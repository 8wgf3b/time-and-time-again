# time-and-time-again

Initially, I created this repo to practice Time-Series. If you check out old commits, you will find me experimenting with different datasets (for example, Covid) with different TSDBs (Postgres for TS, influx dB) and sometimes even modified H5 files to handle data storage. As for the visualization, I found plotly-dash to be more fun and scalable.

Recently, I moved back to using kdb since nothing is more fun than working with it. Part of the repo code manages storage and analysis of chat logs from discord. I'm planning to add other kinds of data like stocks and my personal life stats next.

Checkout the other parts of the discord bot:
